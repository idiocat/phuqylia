Kingdom of Botania spreads across the vast lands of Sous Lesoreiles, claiming **over four fifth** of its various biomes that gave way to multiple cultures; **lack of ores** might be the only thing in common between them. For reasons mostly magical many lands are covered in **domestic forests and fertile plains**, and living in this eden are **[[Elves]]**, *which are*...

Creatures of equally unbound beauty and arrogance; they live up to a 1000 years on average and this makes them aliens with questionable values and weird morales. Things that most value, like homes, family bonds, lives of creatures with shorter lifespan, seem to be elusive concepts to many elves. **Botan of Ruyi, The First Elf, The King of Botania**, as his titles suggest, was the oldest known elf having lived for at least 10400 years and having been the king of Botania for at least 9800 years, so it would only be fair to blame him personally for eradication of many insectoid species, such as coproflies and peebees, and enslavement of many fantastical beasts such as ogres, trolls, hobgoblins, dubgoblins, gobgoblins, wobblegoblins and even **[[Goblins]]**, *which are*...

Small short living creatures, peaceful and unambitious yet cunning and adaptive. When elves came to colonize them, goblins **gave up without a fight**. Over generations they **learnt more and more** about elven society, becoming less and less replaceable. They'd always been willing slaves until over 420 years ago, when Botania drowned in **goblin peaceful demonstrations**, soon followed by a power play: **Vitoria of the familie Elakalyn** changed her title of *Persistent Director of Resistance Directive* for **Trader-Queen of Botania**, and as her first decree banned slavery*! Goblins got everything they asked for and **nearly tripled their population since**; spreading across the whole world they learnt languages and traditions of others all while **spreading their language and trade** (for Botania, of course!).

Elves of Botania apparently were shaped by magic, and that magic got names: **the thirteen elven families created in the image of the thirteen elven gods**, although, apart from appearance tweaks and some mild magic tricks, elves aren't affected by their gods all that much. Maybe, an occasional conversation over a cup of tea. Also, they got **temples** where they gather to discuss their religious revelations and question interpretations; very much the same thing they do at their **magic academies**. They are creators and big innovators of the Path of the [[Wizard]] and the Path of the [[Warlock]] ― two magic disciplines shaped by their connection to magic.

**Agriculture** and **Bureaucracy** ― are other two magic disciplines of elves, **A** and **B** of their way of life. **A!** They use magic to terraform the lands to grow all types of plants, crops and trees, they enchant the whole process of growing the said types, ending up with amplified yet non-magical organic products. And apparently **they grow steel** on trees.
**B!** They conduct a population census, keeping track of all elves and other citizens ever alive, their titles, their properties, their location, etc.; every town has a department of bureaucratic nonsense, they also give passports, verify contracts and organize marriages and other events. All official documents and official currency are **protected by intricate abjuration spells**.

**Other letters**!

**Elvish** ― the language of elves, it's beautiful and ambiguous. It sounds melodic, with specific rules for syllables and low amount of consonants. Words are rather long, but pack a variety of meanings which may change depending on the context; also there're about a dozen versions of each pronoun which may change the meaning of a whole sentence. Basically, it's fantastic for poetry and terrible to keep your documents in.
There're regional dialects of elvish.
Name structure: \[chosen or given name], \[titles in preferred order], of the familie \[familie name]

**Goblinese** ― the language of goblins, it's crude and sometimes just rude. It has a lot of sounds, maybe even too many, maybe incorporating burps and teeth clicking is too much. At least, it has a letter for burp. And it's actually quite fit to keep your documents in and to write contracts, given that anybody but goblins would want to learn it.
There're regional dialects of goblinese.

**Gobella** ― the language of people, it combines goblinese efficiency with elvish elegancy, it's a pidgin that developed over many thousand years between two cultures, and when Goblinisation started it soon became the international language.
