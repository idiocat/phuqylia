Wizards and Artificers are scholars and explorers of planar magic. They study and decipher planar language more known as magic runes which have power of bending the primal plane. They master techniques of collecting planar energy and manifesting these runes at will. The greatest of them go as far as writing their own spells in planar language, the curious ones may find them and add to their planar vocabulary. The spellcasting ability for these classes is Intelligence.
Core features: [[Wizard]], [[Artificer]].

The source of power for Clerics, Paladins and Warlocks is a singular Planar patron, although the nature of their agreements vary and therefore the affinity. Clerics are blessed with the attention by: mostly celestial, sometimes fey, rarely demonic; Paladins swore to follow a certain path and were equipped for it by: evenly celestial and fey, rarely demonic; Warlocks signed a contract with rather specific conditions and are paid in magic by: mostly demonic, sometimes fey, rarely celestial. Since the influence of those entitles on primal plane is limited, so is the damage type of the spells of those classes. It has to be either of primordial or your patron's, check [[Ancestries]] for details. Based on the nature of their agreements, the spellcasting ability for these classes is either Wisdom or Charisma.
Core features: [[Cleric]], [[Paladin]], [[Warlock]].

Druids, unlike other spellcasters, find the source of their magic in their connection to primal plane and its primordial nature. However, the spells they utilize are of planar nature. While Druids root themselves into primal plane (sometimes quite literally), they often become spiritual guides in more than one sense, as they guide weaker planar entities between destinations in order to keep an eye on the said entities and limit their influence over primal plane. Depending on their approach, their spellcasting ability is either Wisdom or Charisma.
Core features: [[Druid]].

Rangers and Monks often follow the druidic teachings regarding things of planar nature, although their solutions differ: while Rangers often (for PCs: always) ally with planar spirits which are quite agreeable to limit their influence to the time of need on their joint journey, Monks choose outer violence in order to keep inner peace, they turn their bodies into primal weapons able to directly punch planar energy. Your spellcasting ability can be either Wisdom or Charisma. For Monks this choice affects the ability you use for your monk features.
Core features: [[Ranger]], [[Monk]].

Bards do not cast magic. Their spellslots represent rather their creativity/popularity then supply of magic energy. Bards simply perform their art, and their art is so good that even planar entities are throwing gifts at them in hope to witness more or play along. The gifts being spells, of course. Bards may be natural performers, good soul-readers or simply well-educated on their trade, respectively their spellcasting ability can be Charisma, Wisdom or Intelligence.
Core features: [[Bard]].

While others seek power without, Sorcerers find theirs within. For a multitude of reasons, a person may be afflicted with planar touch, becoming a bearer of planar energy. Their body is capable of siphoning planar energy of a certain type or producing it. Magic for them is as natural as breathing, therefore their spellcasting ability is Constitution.
Core features and some changes to subclasses: [[Sorcerer]].

Barbarians often have strong natural connection with primal plane, that empowers them beyond physical limitations of their bodies. If somehow you have spells, your spellcasting ability is Constitution.
Fighters and Rogues are simply incredibly skillful at what they do, there's no magic involved. Unless there is, in which case your spellcasting ability can be Charisma, Wisdom or Intelligence, depending on which flavour you prefer for your spellcasting.
Core features: [[Barbarian]], [[Fighter]], [[Rogue]].
