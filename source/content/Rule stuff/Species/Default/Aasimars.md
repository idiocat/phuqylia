**Creature Type**: Humanoid (Default)
**Size**: Medium (about 5-6.5 feet tall)
**Life expectancy**: 80 years
**Speed**: 30 ft

==**Celestial Allotment**==. You were born as a chosen of the heavens. You destiny is already written. You must follow the calling and fulfil your purpose to the best of your abilities. Your alignment is Good. If your alignment is changed or you defy your higher-ups, you'll lose all your ***celestial*** features (it's fine, rebellion is an option).

==**Celestial Affinity**==. Instead of rolling for the amount of hp healed, apply the maximum possible. This can be used once per long rest, as a reaction, on a creature that is receiving healing and that you can see within 30 feet.

**Celestial Resistance**. You have Resistance to ==Necrotic== damage.

**Celestial Hands**. As a Magic action, you touch a creature and roll a number of d4s equal to your Proficiency Bonus. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the total rolled. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

**Celestial Light**. You know the Light cantrip.

**Celestial Revelation**. When you reach character level 3, you can transform as a Bonus Action using one of the options below (choose the option each time you transform). The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it (no action required). Once you transform, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

Once on each of your turns before the transformation ends, you can deal extra damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your Proficiency Bonus, and the extra damage's type is Radiant. ==Also, you gain dark vision of 60 ft, and you can see through magical darkness.==

Here are the transformation options:

*Celestial Wings*. Two spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the transformation ends, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.

*Celestial Radiance*. Searing light temporarily radiates from your eyes and mouth. For the duration, you shed Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, each creature ==of your choice== within 10 feet of you takes Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

*Celestial Shroud*. Your eyes briefly ==irradiate light==, and flightless wings sprout from your back temporarily. Creatures other than your allies within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma/Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.
