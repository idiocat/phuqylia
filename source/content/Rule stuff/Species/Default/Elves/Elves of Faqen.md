1. Every meal you eat must involve copious amounts of raw onions.
2. When you are in a stressful situation, you shout every fourth word you speak.
3. You have a second set of ears that emerge and retract whenever you are actively listening.
4. You can't bear to touch anything valuable without wearing gloves.
5. When you wash or bathe, anything less than uncomfortably hot water feels cold to you.
6. You have to slap some creature roughly before you can get a good night's sleep.
7. You're just not comfortable unless your clothing features garishly contrasting colors or patterns.
8. When you cast a spell, the verbal or somatic component must involve a mild obscenity.

**Propagation of Confusion**. You are immune to acid damage and you know Friends cantrip. You learn Cause Fear at level 3, and Crown of Madness at level 5, you can cast each of these spells once without expending a spellslot.

**Blessing In A Bag**. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see or that can see you. Roll a d100 twice to determine min and max range. Roll cateyes (let cateyes = 2d8): one cateye determines your damage resistances, another cateye determines for how many turns it lasts (your choice). If cateyes are the same value, instead you gain immunity for double the duration; if cateyes are the opposite values (1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5) you can use this feature again later before a long rest. Otherwise, it's once per long rest.
