**Primal Affinity**. Once per week you can use a reaction to treat a nat1 as a nat20 or vice versa. You can target yourself or any creature within 30 feet that can hear you. While this feature isn't on cooldown, you have cold resistance.

**The Weathered Traveler**. You learn Create Bonfire cantrip. You can cast it as a ritual, then it doesn't require concentration and lasts for 8 hours. Also, you can predict the weather in your vicinity for the next 8 hours.

**The King of Nowhere**. Once per long rest you can use an action to utter a command (as if casting the Command spell, but the save is charisma) targeting up to d6 creatures within 30 feet that can hear you.

**The Jester in the Court of Everything**. Once per long rest you can use an action to speak a seemingly ridiculous statement. Any creature within 30 feet that can hear you must make an intelligence, wisdom or charisma save (their choice), if they succeed they can add a d6 to the skill and tool checks based on the ability they chose for the next hour, otherwise they'll think you're silly.
