**Fey Affinity**. You have advantage against charm.

**Fey features**. You have antennas, faceted eyes, etc. (at least one).

**Fey Step**. As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space you can see, once per long rest. When you reach lvl 3, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season:

*Autumn*. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must roll a wis save; on success: take d6 psychic damage, on fail: be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.

*Winter*. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, you can choose up to 2 creatures that can see you within 10 feet. They either: gain {prof.} temp. hp and until the end of their turn their movement is increased by 10 feet, or take d6 lightning damage and lose their reaction.

*Spring*. When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a wis save or be teleported with you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. Alternatively, you can choose an occupied space as your destination, the creature in that space must succeed on a wis save or be forced to switch places with you. If a creature succeeds, you can teleport anyway, dealing {prof.}d6 force damage to both of you (the damage is halved for you) and pushing them into unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of you.

*Summer*. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes {prof.} fire damage. Objects take double the damage and are set on fire (not optional).

**Fey Wild Whims**\*.

*Winter*. You ignore difficult terrain when you dash. Also, you know Light cantrip.

*Spring*. You have swimming or climbing speed equal to your movement. Also, you know Mage Hand or Create Bonfire cantrip. (choose when going into spring)

*Summer*. You have advantage on cha saves. Also, you have breath weapon**.

**Trance**. [[Trance]].


\** **Breath Weapon**. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a dex save. On fail: take 1d10 ==fire== damage; on success: take half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this ==once per long rest.==
