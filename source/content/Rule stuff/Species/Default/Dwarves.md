**Exclusive Darkvision**. You have Darkvision with a range of 120 ft. When in dim light, your vision is reduced to 60 ft. When in bright light, it's reduced to 30 ft and you have disadvantage on checks that rely on vision.

**Tremorsense**. When in any way you're touching a solid surface, you can feel vibrations that go through it. If anything touches the connected surface or moves along it within 30 ft, you'll know, although you can only estimate the size and a rough shape of a creature/object based on impact and you can't sense creatures/objects that aren't moving unless you stomp and make a perception check. If you sense a creature/object, it cannot hide from you as long as it touches the surface.
