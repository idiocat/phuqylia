**Creature Type**: Humanoid (Default)
**Size**: Medium (about 3.5-5 feet tall)
**Life expectancy**: 120 years
**Speed**: 30 feet

**Exclusive Darkvision**. You have Darkvision with a range of 120 ft. When in dim light, your vision is reduced to 60 ft. When in bright light, it's reduced to 30 ft and you have disadvantage on checks that rely on vision.

**Tremorsense**. When in any way you're touching a solid surface, you can feel vibrations that go through it. If anything touches the connected surface or moves along it within 30 ft, you'll know, although you can only estimate the size and a rough shape of a creature/object based on impact and you can't sense creatures/objects that aren't moving unless you stomp and make a perception check. If you sense a creature/object, it cannot hide from you as long as it touches the surface.
The range increases to 150 ft while you're moving at half speed or to 300 ft while you're stationary. Also, you can use a bonus action and target a single creature/object of your choice that you have tremorsensed, then you can localize your tremorsense on the target and 5 ft around it as long as it's within 699 ft, otherwise you're tremorblind and cannot tremorsense around yourself. The target gets only half the AC from cover against your attacks. 
Also also, you have advantage on finding structural weaknesses.

**Dwarven Resilience**. You have Resistance to Poison damage and Poisoned condition.

**Dwarven Toughness**. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level.
