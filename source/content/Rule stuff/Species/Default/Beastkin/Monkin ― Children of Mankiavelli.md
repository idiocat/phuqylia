- **Size**: Medium (about 5-6.5 feet tall)
- **Speed**: 30 ft (walk, climb)

**One with the Kin**. When you're attacked, you can use your reaction to swap places with an ally within 5 ft of you or move 5 ft away if you're on the same spot. The ally becomes the target of that attack; the ally gains advantage on their next attack. Also, you count one size smaller for the purposes of movement and mounting, and (dis)mounting only requires 5 ft. 

**Omni-handed**. If you're not holding anything in your hands and feet, you can move on all fours, increasing your movement by 10 ft. Also, you can use your feet as hands, and you can use your tail to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object.

**Noncommittal**. You have prof. in acrobatics.

**Omnipresent**. You can cast Beast Sense and Animal Messenger, each once per long rest or as rituals. Beast Sense can target unwilling beast if they fail a cha save or willing beastkin. Your spellcasting ability for this spells is wisdom.
