**Celestial Affinity**. Instead of rolling for the amount of hp healed, apply the maximum possible. This can be used once per long rest, as a reaction, on a creature that is receiving healing and that you can see within 30 feet.

**Celestial features**. You have additional eyes in unexpected places (at least 6).

**All-seeing**. You have darkvision of 60 feet and truesight of 10 feet. If you gain darkvision or truesight from other sources, instead you can extend them by 60 and 10 feet respectively.

**Unblinking Observer**. You have advantage on perception checks related to vision. Also, you have advantage on saving throws against blinding. Also also, whenever a feature or a spell gives you shared vision with another creature, you don't become blind.

**Be My Eye**. As an action, once per long rest, you can touch a willing creature and place an invisible eye charm on it. As long as you concentrate (as if you were concentrating on a spell) or up to an hour, you can see trough that creature's eyes and it benefits from your All-seeing feature.
