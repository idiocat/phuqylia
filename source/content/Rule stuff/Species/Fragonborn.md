**Creature Type**: Humanoid (Reptilian)
**Size**: Medium (about 5-6.5 feet tall)
**Life expectancy**: 30 years
**Speed**: 20 feet (walk, swim)

**Jumpy**. Your legs are made for jumping, not walking. When you jump, you spend 1 ft, of movement per 2 ft. of distance covered* (if your str is less than 10, consider it to be 10 for the purpose of jumping), and you suffer no penalties if you jump without acceleration. Also, you have resistance against falling damage. Also, you can use a reaction to remove advantage given by your airborne status on 1 attack ==and impose a disadvantage instead==.

**Watery**. You’re a moist boy. You need some water on your skin at least once a week; if you fail to immerse yourself in water for at least 1 hour during a day, you suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of that day. You can only recover from this exhaustion through magic or by immersing yourself in water for at least 1 hour. Also, you can breathe air and water.

**Fragon Ancestry**. Your ancestry is tied to one of the greatest forces of primal and arcane (your choice affects your appearance and character quirk):

**==Magically attuned==**. You learn 2 cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. At lvl 3 you also learn 1 spell from the sorcerer spell list, you may cast this spell once per short rest without expanding a spellslot. You may switch any of these spells when you finish a long rest, or you may switch 1 cantrip on a short rest. The damage of these spells, if any, must be one of your Affiliated Damage types. The spellcasting ability for these spells is Constitution. Also, when you take Infuriating Damage, {prof.} times per long rest, as a reaction you may reduce that damage by {con. mod + d6 (5: 2d6; 11: 3d6; 17: 4d6)}, as a part of this reaction you can either cast a cantrip from this feature or restore the use of the spell from this feature.

**Fragonic Leap**. When you reach lvl 5, you can channel fragonic magic to give yourself temporary flight \[*sic!*]. As a Bonus Action, you cast Jump on yourself. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.



\* e.g., with 20 movement speed and 10 strength, you can jump for 20 feet and still have 10 movement speed left
