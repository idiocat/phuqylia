* **Size**: Medium (about 5-6.5 ft tall)

**Hooves**. Your hooves aren't powerful, but that's all you got *going* for you. They deal {d4 + str. mod} bludgeoning damage and have Push mastery.

**Roadhouse Kick**. You can use your reaction to kick an enemy that enters your melee range. If you miss this attack, you can make another attack against a different enemy. You can keep *going* until you hit somebody or miss everybody.

**Sugar Rush**. You have advantage against effects that would reduce your movement. When you break out of such effects, you can take dash action for free. Also, once per short rest, when you take dash action, you can triple your movement instead of doubling it.
