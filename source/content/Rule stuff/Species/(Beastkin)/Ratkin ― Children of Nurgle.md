**Living a Life**. You've got some tricks up your sleeves, in your pockets and maybe even up your butthole. They might be a bit dirty. You can use a bonus action to perform one of the following {prof.} times per short rest, otherwise you can use an action.
* *Go for the Eyes*. Up to {prof.} creatures, which are up to 5 ft away, lose their reactions.
* *Play Sick*. Until the start of your next turn, all attacks against you have disadvantage as long as the attacker can see you, and you can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, moving through creatures doesn't count as difficult terrain.
* *Kick 'em Balls*. A creature of your choice, up to 5 ft away, has disadvantage on their next attack and its movement reduced by 10 ft until the end of their next turn, while your movement is increased by 10 ft until the end your turn.

**Eating Shit and Loving It**. You're res. to being poisoned and non-magical diseases*. Also, while in a city, you can find enough nutrients to sustain up to 4 small/medium creatures for a day.

**Point Fingers and Laugh**. You know Vicious Mockery cantrip. When you cast it: if there's an ally within 5 ft of the target, the target gets disadvantage on its saving throw; if there's an ally within 5 ft of you and they can see the target, they can use their reaction to cast Vicious Mockery on the same target (even if they don't know the cantrip).
