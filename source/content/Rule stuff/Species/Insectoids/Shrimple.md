**Tools for the trade**. Choose 2 weapons (can't be heavy or two-handed); you're prof. with them and can use their masteries. Choose 1 tool/kit, you're prof. with it. These are parts of your body, you always have them on your person and you don't need a free hand to use them. The proficiencies/masteries are limited to your body parts and don't provide you knowledge of using their artificial analogs.

**Born to not crawl**. A pair of auxiliary hind legs allows you to have a comfy seat anywhere you want. Also, you only need 5 ft. to get up or get to speed before jumping.
