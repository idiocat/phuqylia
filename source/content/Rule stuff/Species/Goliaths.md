**==Primal Affinity==**. Choose a skill you're proficient in. Whenever you roll a skill check, add d6. You can change this skill once a week.

**Large Form**. Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to Large as a Bonus Action if you're in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no action required). For that duration, you have Advantage on Strength checks, and your Speed increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

**Powerful Build**. You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the Grappled condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

**Land Affinity**. Goliath have a close connection to the place of their birth. Choose one of the following benefits — a primordial boon; you can use the chosen benefit {prof.} times per Long Rest:

* **The Glacial Expanse** (ice sheet, snow land, tundra). When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d6 Cold damage to that target and reduce its movement by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
* **The Whispering Flatlands** (grassland, steppe, chaparral). When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the Prone condition.
* **The Gilded Wastes** (desert, scrubland, savanna). When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d10 Fire damage to that target.
* **==The Verdant Veils==** (temperate forest, rainforest, boreal forest). When you take a hide action, you can create an illusion and make yourself look like a tree of about the same size. You have advantage against being discovered while hidden in this way.
* **The Fluid Borders** (wetlands, coastlines, islands). As a Bonus Action, you magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
* **The Bouldered Bones** (hills, mountains, caves). When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total.
