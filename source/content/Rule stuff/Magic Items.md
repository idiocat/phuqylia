**Finger Cot of Holding for a Minute**. While wearing this finger cot on your finger, you can flick your fingers as you let go of an item that weighs 10 pounds or less. The item is then suspended in the air wherever you left it for a minute or until it's affected by external force. Before the minute expires, you can flick your fingers again, making the item float in the direction of the flick for 10 feet or until it's affected by external force. If the minute expires or the item floats for 10 feet, the item then slowly descends for 10 feet.
*Warning*: using more than one FCHM**™** on the same hand or putting FCHM**™** on anything else than a finger may cause trauma, otherwise FCHM**™** is completely safe.
