## COMBAT

**Surprise Attack**. The surprising creatures roll initiative with advantage, while the surprised ones roll initiative with disadvantage.

**Flanking**. A creature is considered Surrounded when it has 2 hostile creatures on the opposite sides or 3 hostile creatures total ― in melee range. A creature doesn't count towards the number of surrounding creatures, if it's in melee range of other hostile creatures. All attacks against Surrounded creature are made with advantage, and Surrounded creature has disadvantage on str and dex saves.

**Brutal Crits**. On crit, instead of rolling twice, roll once and max out the other roll.

**Massive Damage**. When a creature takes damage in one attack equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 con save or roll a d10 and suffer.

| Roll | **Effect**                                                                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The creature drops to 0 hit points.                                                                                       |
| 2–3  | The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable.                                                                         |
| 4–5  | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn.                                                                   |
| 6–7  | The creature can’t take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8–10 | The creature can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.                                                         |

**Pack Tactics**. Now gives a creature an advantage when attacking creatures that were hit by their ally since the end of their last turn.

**Critical Immunity**. Now makes an attacker reroll their damage die if they max roll. This would turn a brutal crit into a normal crit.

**Death Saves**. While making death saves, a creature can remain semi-conscious if they succeed on a dc {10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher} con save. They cannot take reactions or cast lvled spells, and during their turn they can only perform one of the following: action, bonus action or move up to {movement/3} (minimum of 10 ft). Some actions (like attacking) will reward a creature with auto failed death saves. Also, pm ur ds to dm.

**Healing Potions**. Bonus action to roll the healing, action to max out the healing.

**Grazing**. Attack rolls equal to the target’s AC deal half damage.
\[for conformity]
## MARTIAL

**Cleaving Through**. When an attack brings an undamaged creature to 0 hp, excess damage is carried over and dealt to another creature, given that the initial roll is enough to hit and it's in the melee range of the attacker.

**Got the High Ground**. Ranged and thrown weapon range is increased depending on the vertical distance above the target. Normal range += vertical height; long range += 2x vertical height. 

**[[Masteries (WIP)]]**. Martial weapons have 2 masteries. Each mastery must be learnt individually, and only one mastery can be applied to an attack (must choose before rolling an attack, except for Graze Mastery).

**Other [[Weapon Changes]]**. Some weapons are useful now, hopefully.

## MAGIC

**Freestyle spellcasting**. Some spells that do not upcast can be upcasted with various benefits, and spells that do upcast can be upcasted for different benefits. Only one parameter is scaled when upcasting. A caster needs to make a spellcasting check to modify a spell.

**Counterspell and dispell**. While considered spells by amateurs, these are rather techniques of unweaving magic than actual spellcasting. A spell is automatically countered/dispelled if it's cast at the same or lower lvl, otherwise make a DC {10+2*(lvl difference)} spellcasting check. The countered spell\[slot] is wasted. Also, counterspell and dispel can be downcasted down to lvl 1.

**Other [[Spell Changes]]**. (In)direct changes to (un)certain spells.

## EXPLORATION/EXPLOTATION

**Jumping**. A creature can jump over their speed limit, they'll be suspended in the air until the start of their next turn, at which point they have to continue the jump. Attacks against airborne (due to jumping) creatures have advantage.

**Falling**. Fall damage is capped at 150d6; creatures can make acrobatics checks to avoid being prone and halve the damage.

| distance | dc  |
| -------- | --- |
| 10       | 10  |
| 20       | 16  |
| 30       | 25  |
| 40       | 37  |
| 50       | no  |
**ASI**. ASI is not an option for when you choose a feat. Feats that provide ability score increase will instead give other benefits.

**Primal Growth**. PCs can increase their ability scores among a multitude of other bonuses by completing Personal Quests (PQ). PQs can vary from "want to hit harder" to "must secretly worship a demonic entity and help it end the world". PQs can be progressed in a variety of ways: e.g., if one "wants to hit harder", they could hit the gym (boring!) or they could complete something like the twelve labours of hercules (epic!). PQs can be self-imposed or offered by dm. PQs may offer permanent or temporary thematic mechanical benefits as they progress and/or on their completion. PCs can have up to {prof.} PQs.
## OTHER

**Rounding**. Round to the nearest odd number unless stated otherwise.

**Half-bloods**. A PC can be a mix of 2 species as long as both of them are humanoid (default). See [[Orcs and Half-orcs (xoxo)]] if you wanna get an idea of how it works, otherwise i can't be bothered to dive into it unless needed.

**Situational Inspiration**. A player can have up to 4 SI, each is represented by a d6 that can be spent to add to a d20 roll. Chaotically given out by dm.
