Conjuration Cantrip
**Casting Time**: Action
**Range**: 30 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: 1 minute
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

This modification of Mage Hand cantrip isn't made for delicate manipulations, its purpose is to destroy. The hand's strength score is {your str - 1} and it can carry anything that one-handed person with that strength can carry. The hand can manipulate a one-handed weapon (your proficiencies are applied, but not masteries) and whenever you take an attack action you can replace one of your attacks with the hand's attack, also you can use your reaction to strike with the hand. If not carrying a weapon, the hand can replace its attack with shove or grapple. When attacking an object, the hand automatically crits and is destroyed.

As a part of casting and as a Magic action on your later turns, you can control the hand moving it up to 30 feet and making 1 attack with it. Alternatively, you can move the hand up to 10 feet as a part of your attack action.

The hand can't activate magic items.
