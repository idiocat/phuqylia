**Bastian's Backtrack** (*Conjuration, lvl 3, Concentration (yes), Action, V, M: Spyglass). Record your location when you cast this spell. As long as you concentrate, you can take a Reaction to avoid an attack, a spell, or a hostile creature moving within 5 feet of you to teleport back to that location, or to the nearest unoccupied space taking 4d6 force damage. When concentration ends against your will you'll be teleported to the location, otherwise you may choose whether you teleport or stay.
*Sometimes you look around and find out that you're 8 kilometers deep in your thoughts.*

**Bastian's Hangover** (*Enchantment, lvl 2, 10 minutes, Action (30 feet), S, M: a bottle of strong liquor that you must drink as part of casting*). You emit a drunken aura that quickly washes away, leaving an intense hangover. You and a creature you choose within range make a con save: on fail, gain Poisoned until the end of the duration; on success, end Poisoned. While Poisoned by this spell, if you or the target roll 5 or below to save, you or the target become Stunned until the end of yours or their next turn; also, the target has Disadvantage on con saves to maintain Concentration or to end the condition.
After the spell ends, you and the target must make a con save: on fail, gain a lvl of exhaustion as if you spent the night drinking.
*Not many can handle this spell. This is precisely why I made it.*

**Bastian's Third-person Sight** (Divination, lvl 1, Concentration (1 minute), Bonus Action, S, M: mask, monocle or glasses that you must keep on your face while concentrating). You project your vision to see through an invisible sensor which appears in a spot about 1-2 feet above and behind you, giving you a view of your rear in the vicinity and far enough ahead, as if you were looking at your crown.
The sensor moves with you, retaining its position in relation to your crown. You can use a bonus action to adjust the sensor's position, but no more than 60 deg to the right/left and 30 deg up/down.
While looking through this sensor you are Blind.
On upcast: lvl 2 - 10 minutes, lvl 4 - 3 hours, lvl 6 - yes.
*Gotta watch your back, mate.*

**Bastian's Uncomprehend Languages** (Enchantment, lvl 2, Concentration (1 minute), Action, V, S) This spell grants the creature you touch extreme dyslexia, making them unable to understand any spoken or signed language that it hears or sees. Moreover, the target cannot communicate by speaking or signing, however they preserve an ability to think straight and their thoughts cannot be deciphered. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a charisma save.
On upcast: lvl 4 - 10 minutes, lvl 6 - 1 hour, lvl 8 - 24 hours, lvl 9 - yes.
*How would they know what I'm thinking, if I don't?*
