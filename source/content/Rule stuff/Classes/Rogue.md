**Reactive**. You have 2 reactions per round, as well as additional options to use your reactions (choose 1, choose 1 more at rogue levels 6 and 12):

*Quick reiteration*. When you fail a dex save, you can reroll it once per round.

*Tactical retreat*. When somebody is approaching you, once per round you can move up to half your movement away in the same direction, potentially escaping their melee range.

*Reoccurring inertia*. When you are moved, you can additionally move up to 10 feet, without triggering attacks of opportunity.

*Racket area*. When somebody ends their turn next to your ally and within the normal range of your currently equipped ranged/thrown weapon, you can make a ranged attack against them. Doesn't apply to weapons with Loading property, unless you can ignore it.

*Double repenetration*. When your ally is attacking somebody in your melee range, you can make a melee attack against their target.

*Dramatic reopening*. When your turn starts, you can make an attack with disadvantage with the weapon you're currently holding. Ranged/thrown weapons are limited to normal range.


**Sneak Attack**? Ally proximity doesn't trigger sneak attack.
\[simplify! it's simply redundant with homebrew flanking rules]

Also, you get prof. with buckler.
