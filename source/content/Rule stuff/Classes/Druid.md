**Primordial Blessing**. Once per long rest, instead of rolling for a skill check, you can instead get the minimum required to succeed. This only applies to skills you're not prof. in.

**Spirit Guide**. You druidic training has provided you with an ability to communicate with the planewalkers. They often ask you for guidance and you can choose to lead the spirit by bounding it to your body. While a spirit is bound to you, you gain the benefit of their ancestry and your body becomes an arcane focus. The damage type of your druid spells is limited to those of your spirit's and primordial, while without a spirit it's only primordial (check [[Ancestries]] for details).
Also, you can spend a bonus action to receive a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]) {spellcasting ability mod} times per spirit. Roll a d6 to determine the bonus. Instead of random bonus, you can cast Detect Magic for free.
To determine, which spirit is currently bound to you, roll a d6. You can choose to reroll this result on a long rest. Starting at lvl 11, your connection to the primal becomes strong enough for you to bound up to two spirits (roll 2d6). At lvl 17, instead of rolling one of d6, you can choose.

| [[Ancestries]] | Die     |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Fey            | 1, 4, 6 |
| Celestial      | 2       |
| Demonic        | 3       |
| Aberrant*      | 5       |
**Planar form**. You can use a bonus action and expand a charge of wild shape in order to receive a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]). Choose a bonus.

Also, your spellcasting ability is either wisdom or charisma.


\* you gain 1 free use of Clairvoyance or Identify that can be used while the spirit is still bound
