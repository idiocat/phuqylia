**Integrated Tech Solutions**. As an artificer, you don't cast spells, instead you enchant various items so that they cast spells instead of you (consult app. 0). As a result, your "spellcasting" is modified in 10 ways:
0. You ignore normal component requirements for spells, unless it's M which has a specific cost. Instead, you can define your own components, but you have to **i***n***t***e***r***a***c***t* with an item used to cast a spell in some way.
1. You don't restore spellslots on a long rest, as well as any class features that only restore on long rest. Instead, you need to tinker with your equipment for 2 hours continuously. While tinkering, you can also change the components of your spells as specified in article 0 as well as their damage type (consult app. 1).

For each level of the spell, the designing takes 4 hours and costs 100 GP. Afterward you can integrate the spell into your tinkering routine as specified in **ITS**' articles.
