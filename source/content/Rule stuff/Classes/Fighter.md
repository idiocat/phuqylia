**Double-Edged Assault**. You can use your combat prowess to overwhelm your opponents, striking with might that disrupts their attacks and backfires when you're not attacked. You can use a bonus action and a second wind charge, in order to, at the end of your turn, gain temp hp equal to the amount of damage you dealt. At the start of your next turn, take {2x remaining temp hp} force damage.

**Secret techniques**. You gain an additional fighting style, as well as an access to additional fighting style options for it:

*Slow and steady*. For every 20 feet of movement left at the end of your turn, you gain +1 to DC and saving throws (but no more than your {prof.}) until the start of your next turn.

*Fast and furious*. For every 20 feet of movement spent this turn, you gain +1 to attack and damage rolls (but no more than your {prof.}) until the start of your next turn.

*Voodoo warrior*. You learn 2 cantrips of your choice from wizard spell list. You can replace one of your attacks with a cantrip from this feature.

*Naked brutality*. While not wearing armour, and wielding a melee weapon, your base AC equals 10 + your weapon attack mod.
