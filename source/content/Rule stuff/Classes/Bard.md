**Favoured**. You gain the [[Favoured]] feat. Whenever you gain a feat, you may choose this feat again.

**Arcane Inspiration.** When you give bardic inspiration to somebody, they can choose to use it to receive a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]). If they have Spellcasting, they roll a d6, no action required, to determine the bonus. Otherwise, they gain a free random spell (no spellslot, no M).

All your spells are results of your performance, therefore to cast them you must make sure that the show goes on: play your instrument, dance or do whatever performance you got as V, S, M components of your spells. If M has a specific cost, you still need it.
Also, your spellcasting ability is either intelligence, wisdom or charisma.
