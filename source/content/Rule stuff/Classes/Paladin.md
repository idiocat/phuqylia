**Patron Guide**. Depending on your patron's ancestry, the damage type of your paladin spells is limited to those of your patron's and primordial (check [[Ancestries]] for details).

**The Path Provides**. Whenever a creature in your aura receives a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]), you can use a reaction to receive one as well. Roll a d6 to determine the bonus. Alternatively, you can spend a charge of channel divinity as a bonus action, in which case roll 2d6 and gain 2 bonuses, if you roll doubles instead choose 2 different bonuses. And yes, you can have up to 2 stacks of [[Magic Bullshit]], each bonus has its own duration, and its effects can't be same.

Also, your spellcasting ability is either wisdom or charisma.
