**Patron Daddy**. Depending on your patron's ancestry, the damage type of your cleric spells is limited to those of your patron's and primordial (check [[Ancestries]] for details).

**Sugar baby.** You gain up to +/-2 to your ability checks and saves of your spellcasting ability, depending on how faithful you’ve been. Also, you can use a bonus action to give a quick pray to your patron in order to receive a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]). Roll a d6 to determine the bonus. You can use this feature {prof. + sugar baby mod.} times per long rest, or you can expend a charge of channel divinity.

**Planar Guidance**. When you cast guidance, you can choose to either double the guidance die or target an additional creature. You can use this feature {prof. + sugar baby mod.} times per long rest. Starting at lvl 15, you can add your sugar baby mod. to the amount of dice or targets (min. is 1).

Also, your spellcasting ability is either wisdom or charisma and all of your cleric spells have verbal component.
