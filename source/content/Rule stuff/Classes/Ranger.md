**Spirit Partner**. You have a spirit (you may choose what the spirit looks like (although it can only be seen by "detect magic") and the spirit's alignment) that follows you (the spirit always is within 5 feet of you or directly on you) and casts magic for you. Your spells can originate from the spirit. The spirit is in partnership with you and you can talk to spirit telepathically.
The spirit is vulnerable to acid damage, resistant to psychic, radiant, necrotic damage and immune to anything else. The spirit's hp is equal to {your hit die multiplied by half your ranger level rounded down}. If the spirit dies, you can summon it back with a ritual that takes an hour to perform. Due to spirit's nature, the damage type of your ranger spells is limited to those of fey and primordial (check [[Ancestries]] for details).

Your spirit can concentrate on Hunter's Mark, but in this case its extra damage is reduced to d4. Starting at lvl 9, you can use your reaction to reapply Hunter's Mark.

**Bull's Eye**. Whenever you cast hunter's mark, you receive a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]) and its effect also applied to the hunter's mark.

Also, your spellcasting ability is either wisdom or charisma and your spirit is an arcane focus.

The following features are changed so that they suck less:

**Lvl 13: Attuned Hunter**. Once per short rest you can ask the spirit for an advice. Roll insight or persuasion against spell save DC, if you succeed you gain +2 to your spellcasting checks. Also, the damage of Hunter's Mark is increased to d10 when you concentrate on it, or to d6 when the spirit does.

**Lvl 20: Foe Slayer**. The damage die of your Hunter's Mark is a d12, no matter who concentrates on it.
