**Primal Will**. Once per long rest, when you make a {your ~~spellcasting~~ focus ability} save throw, you can treat that roll as a nat20.

**Primal Punch**. You can "cast" Counterspell and Dispel Magic without any components, expanding 1 focus point per lvl of spell, but no more than half your monk lvl. The range of these spells for you is touch (e.g., you can break a fireball with a punch or slap a creature out of Charmed effect). You can expand an additional focus point and replace one of your attacks with a technique from this feature.

**Trance**. [[Trance]].
