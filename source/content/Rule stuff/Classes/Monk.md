**Primal Will**. Once per long rest, when you make a saving throw based on your ~~spellcasting~~ focus ability, you can treat that roll as a nat20.

**Primal Punch**. You can "cast" Counterspell and Dispel Magic without any components, expending 1 focus point per lvl of spell, but no more than half your monk lvl. The range of these ~~spells~~ techniques for you is touch (e.g., you can break a fireball with a punch or slap a creature out of Charmed effect). You can expend an additional focus point and replace one of your attacks with a ~~spell~~ technique from this feature.

**Trance**. [[Trance]].
