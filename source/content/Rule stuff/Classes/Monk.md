**Primal Growth**. After multiple long meditations/training sessions, you can choose a virtue (it's like an extra feat or a magical item (without the actual item), you can decide what it does, however your decision may be subjected to perversion by dm). You can have up to {your proficiency bonus} active virtues.

**Primal Punch**. You know Counterspell and Dispel Magic. You can cast them without any components, expanding 1 focus point per lvl of spell, but no more than half your monk lvl. The range of these spells for you is touch (e.g., you can break a fireball with a punch or slap a creature out of Charmed effect).
