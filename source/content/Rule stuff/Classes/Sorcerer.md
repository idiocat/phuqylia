**Push the limit**. As a bonus action, you can invoke the magic running through your body to gain a spellcasting related bonus ([[Magic Bullshit]]). Make a constitution check; if you fail, first time nothing happens, every consecutive failure will give you a level of exhaustion.
Also, your spellcasting ability is constitution and your body is an arcane focus.

**Planar Ancestry.** Your body is a vessel of powerful planar essence (your choice affects damage types and ancestral heritage): 

| Ancestry   | Damage Types                                                   | Heritage ([[Ancestries]] for details)                                                                                                                                                | SP    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Primordial | Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison | high skill expertise (treat a roll on a d20 test as a nat20) \[reaction]                                                                                                             | 13    |

| Celestial  | Slashing, Lightning, Thunder, Radiant                          | once per long rest you can max out healing (do it again) \[reaction]                                                                                                                 | 3*lvl |
| Demonic    | Bludgeoning, Fire, Force, Necrotic                             | resistance against fear (resistance to all your damage types and some conditions \[poisoned, petrified, diseased, burning and movement restriction\] for 10 minutes) \[bonus action] | 4     |
| Aberrant   | Acid, Psychic, Radiant, Necrotic, Cold                         | charm of the Eldritch Orb (gain another charge) \[ritual]                                                                                                                            | all** |
Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you can expand {spell lvl} sorcery points and switch that damage to one of your available damage types. Moreover, if a spell deals damage that is not one of your available damage types, you must change the damage type; you can do so without expanding sorcery points, but you don't get to choose.

Starting at lvl 5, you gain your heritage feature. If your species has planar affinity, that affinity is the only option for your heritage, and you may have further limitations in areas related to planar ancestry***. You can expand sorcery points to amplify your heritage and gain benefits in the brackets.

** *you must ingest aberrant essence*
*** e.g., ~~draconic~~ fragonic subclass



#### Fragonic Sorcery

**Level 3: Choose your Fragon**
Your heritage isn't exactly planar, rather you're somehow connected to a fragon. Choose fragon type with which your share the heritage. You can switch your heritage between the available ones on a long rest.

| Fragon             | Amplified Damage Types | Resistance | Heritages                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Tourmaline         | Fire, Poison           | Force      | Primordial, Fey, Demonic     |
| Lapis Lazuli       | Radiant, Psychic       | Thunder    | Fey, Celestial, Aberrant     |
| Lace Agate         | Lightning, Thunder     | Poison     | Primordial, Fey, Celestial   |
| Hematite           | Necrotic, Force        | Psychic    | Fey, Demonic, Aberrant       |
| Ammolite           | Psychic, Poison        | Cold       | Primordial, Fey, Aberrant    |
| Snowflake Obsidian | Necrotic, Radiant      | Acid       | Celestial, Demonic, Aberrant |

**Level 3: Fragonic Constitution**
The magic in your body is stored in a fat-like magic layer. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Some magic accumulates into local bloating points. When you take damage, as a reaction you can expend any number of hit dice to cast a spell of {hit dice used} lvl, but less than your maximum lvl spellslot, without expanding a spellslot, or a cantrip (1 die). The spell can't have M that is consumed or has a cost, and ignores VS; the spell can't have concentration; if the spell needs a target, the target is semi-random (e.g., a harmful spell will aim at enemies).

**Level 3: Fragonic Spells**
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Fragonic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| lvl | Spells                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 3   | Alter Self, Chromatic Orb, Jump, Magic Missile |
| 5   | Fear, Haste                                    |
| 7   | Arcane Eye, Charm Monster                      |
| 9   | Legend Lore, Summon Fragon                     |

**Level 6: Fragonic Amplification**

Consult the "choose your fragon" table. You gain the respective resistance; and when you cast a spell that deals one of the Amplified Damage Types, you can add your spellcasting ability mod. to one damage roll of that spell.

**Level 14: Fragon Legs**
As a Bonus Action, you can transform your legs into a perfect shape (for 1 hour or until you dismiss them) which allow you to jump spending 1 ft. of ms for 3 ft. of distance covered. As a part of this bonus action, you can also cast Jump on yourself without expanding a spellslot, and its duration is modified to last until the end of your transformation.
Also, you suffer no penalties if you jump without acceleration. Also, you have resistance against falling damage. Also, you can use a reaction to remove advantage given by your airborne status on 1 attack.

Once used, this feature can't be used again until you finish a Long Rest or spend 4 Sorcery Points.

**Level 18: Ultimate Fragonality**
Instead of switching between your ancestries, you gain access to all of them, and whenever you invoke one ancestry bonus, as a part of that bonus action/reaction you can invoke another one. Also, you get 25% refund of SP spent on invoking your ancestry bonuses and features of this subclass.

When you cast Summon Fragon, you can roll Persuasion, Insight or Arcana against DC {10 + spell lvl}. On a success, the spell requires no concentration; however with a 5 or lower on the die the spell also requires no concentration, but the fragonic spirit turns hostile.
