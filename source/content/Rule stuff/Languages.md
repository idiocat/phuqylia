At start you know {2 + int mod} languages. {1 + int. mod/2} can be of native lvl. You also know the accents at 1 lvl lower, modern/old dialects at 2 lvls lower, ancient dialects at 3 lvls lower*. You can get better at languages as you immerse yourself in the environment of that language, up to nerd lvl.

language lvls:
*basic*. enough to communicate basic ideas such as: ask directions or buy groceries. you have disadvantage on speaking checks if you're speaking this language;
*okay*. you can pretty much communicate more or less normally, yet you have disadvantage on checks to impersonate somebody native at this language if you're speaking this language;
*nerd*. you understand even the most subtle connotations and know rather specific vocabulary;
*native*. you're not a nerd.


\* jic: don't bother listing those
